# TaskMaster — Static UI Recreation

This repository contains a static HTML/CSS/JS recreation of the UI shown in the provided references (login card and dashboard layout).

Files created
- `index.html` — Login screen (replicates the card in the reference).
- `dashboard.html` — Static dashboard screen (cards, sidebar, quick actions).
- `css/styles.css` — All page styles.
- `js/script.js` — Small interactive behaviors (tab toggle, Next Step navigation).

How to preview
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or open from your editor). It is static — no server required.
2. Click "Next Step" on the login card to jump to `dashboard.html`.

Notes & next steps
- This is a static recreation (no backend). It aims to match the visual structure and layout from your reference images.
- If you want closer pixel-perfect visuals, provide the exact brand assets (logo, SVG shapes) and I can refine colors, spacing, and shadows further.

Enjoy — open `Dahboard.html` to preview.
